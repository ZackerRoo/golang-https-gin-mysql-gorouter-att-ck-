  description: |
    Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by Microsoftâ€™s Windows NT operating systems that grant system administrators 
    remote access to every disk volume on a network-connected system. These shares are automatically created at startup unless they have been
    purposefully disabled as is done in this Atomic test. As Microsoft puts it, "Missing administrative shares typically 
    indicate that the computer in question has been compromised by malicious software."
